1. 运算符重载的意义

   C++内置类型（int,char,double...）的运算符不可以重载，只可以重载用户定义的类型(class, struct, union and enum)。

   Not all operators can be overloaded in C++. Among the operators that cannot be overloaded are: `.` `::` `sizeof` `typeid` `.*` and the only ternary operator in C++, `?:`

   Among the operators that can be overloaded in C++ are these:

   - arithmetic operators: `+` `-` `*` `/` `%` and `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=` `%=` (all binary infix); `+` `-` (unary prefix); `++` `--` (unary prefix and postfix)
   - bit manipulation: `&` `|` `^` `<<` `>>` and `&=` `|=` `^=` `<<=` `>>=` (all binary infix); `~` (unary prefix)
   - boolean algebra: `==` `!=` `<` `>` `<=` `>=` `||` `&&` (all binary infix); `!` (unary prefix)
   - memory management: `new` `new[]` `delete` `delete[]`
   - implicit conversion operators
   - miscellany: `=` `[]` `->` `->*` `,` (all binary infix); `*` `&` (all unary prefix) `()` (function call, n-ary infix)

   可以使用运算符重载，但是不是必须使用。

   运算符重载是一个有特殊名字的函数。运算符可以通过成员函数（left operand's type）或者非成员函数。比如成员函数operator+, x+y 可以翻译成x.operator(y)。非成员函数operator+，x+y可以翻译成operator+(x,y)。

   非成员运算符函数有时需要声明为friend函数。

   

2. 运算符重载的三个规则

   (1). 当运算符的意义不是100%明确时候，不应该重载。

   (2). 永远贴近运算符本来的含义。+的含义不能是-

   (3). 永远提供一系列的操作方法。提供+号，+=也应该提供；提供++a，a++也应该提供。

3. 成员方法VS非成员函数

   The binary operators `=` (assignment), `[]` (array subscription), `->` (member access), as well as the n-ary `()` (function call) operator, must always be implemented as ***member functions***, because the syntax of the language requires them to.

   Other operators can be implemented either as members or as non-members. Some of them, however, usually have to be implemented as non-member functions, because their left operand cannot be modified by you. The most prominent of these are the input and output operators `<<` and `>>`, whose left operands are stream classes from the standard library which you cannot change.

   ```{C++}
   friend std::ostream & operator<<(std::ostream & out, const ClassA & A);
   friend std::istream & operator>>(std::istream & in, ClassA & A);
   /*
   Friends are neither public or private, and can be listed anywhere within the class declaration.
   The cout and cin need to be passed into the function by reference, so that the function accesses the cout and cin directly (instead of a clone copy by value).
   We return the cin and cout passed into the function by reference too, so as to support cascading operations. For example, cout << p1 << endl will be interpreted as (cout << p1) << endl.
   In <<, the reference parameter Point is declared as const. Hence, the function cannot modify the Point object. On the other hand, in >>, the Point reference is non-const, as it will be modified to keep the input.
   We use fully-qualified name std::istream instead of placing a "using namespace std;" statement in the header. It is because this header could be included in many files, which would include the using statement too and may not be desirable.
   */
   ```

   

   For all operators where you have to choose to either implement them as a member function or a non-member function, ***use the following rules of thumb*** to decide:

   1. If it is a ***unary operator***, implement it as a ***member*** function.
   2. If a binary operator treats ***both operands equally*** (it leaves them unchanged), implement this operator as a ***non-member*** function.
   3. If a binary operator does ***not*** treat both of its operands ***equally*** (usually it will change its left operand), it might be useful to make it a ***member*** function of its left operand’s type, if it has to access the operand's private parts.

   Of course, as with all rules of thumb, there are exceptions. If you have a type

   ```cpp
   enum Month {Jan, Feb, ..., Nov, Dec}
   ```

   and you want to overload the increment and decrement operators for it, you cannot do this as a member functions, since in C++, enum types cannot have member functions. So you have to overload it as a free function. And `operator<()` for a class template nested within a class template is much easier to write and read when done as a member function inline in the class definition. But these are indeed rare exceptions.

   (However, *if* you make an exception, do not forget the issue of `const`-ness for the operand that, for member functions, becomes the implicit `this` argument. If the operator as a non-member function would take its left-most argument as a `const` reference, the same operator as a member function needs to have a `const` at the end to make `*this` a `const` reference.)

4. 常用的运算符重载

   Most of the work in overloading operators is boiler-plate code. That is little wonder, since operators are merely syntactic sugar, their actual work could be done by (and often is forwarded to) plain functions. But it is important that you get this boiler-plate code right. If you fail, either your operator’s code won’t compile or your users’ code won’t compile or your users’ code will behave surprisingly.

   ## Assignment Operator

   There's a lot to be said about assignment. However, most of it has already been said in [GMan's famous Copy-And-Swap FAQ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3279543/what-is-the-copy-and-swap-idiom), so I'll skip most of it here, only listing the perfect assignment operator for reference:

   ```cpp
   X& X::operator=(X rhs)
   {
     swap(rhs);
     return *this;
   }
   ```

   ## Bitshift Operators (used for Stream I/O)

   The bitshift operators `<<` and `>>`, although still used in hardware interfacing for the bit-manipulation functions they inherit from C, have become more prevalent as overloaded stream input and output operators in most applications. For guidance overloading as bit-manipulation operators, see the section below on Binary Arithmetic Operators. For implementing your own custom format and parsing logic when your object is used with iostreams, continue.

   The stream operators, among the most commonly overloaded operators, are binary infix operators for which the syntax specifies no restriction on whether they should be members or non-members. Since they change their left argument (they alter the stream’s state), they should, according to the rules of thumb, be implemented as members of their left operand’s type. However, their left operands are streams from the standard library, and while most of the stream output and input operators defined by the standard library are indeed defined as members of the stream classes, when you implement output and input operations for your own types, you cannot change the standard library’s stream types. That’s why you need to implement these operators for your own types as non-member functions. The canonical forms of the two are these:

   ```cpp
   std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const T& obj)
   {
     // write obj to stream
   
     return os;
   }
   
   std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& is, T& obj)
   {
     // read obj from stream
   
     if( /* no valid object of T found in stream */ )
       is.setstate(std::ios::failbit);
   
     return is;
   }
   ```

   When implementing `operator>>`, manually setting the stream’s state is only necessary when the reading itself succeeded, but the result is not what would be expected.

   ## Function call operator

   The function call operator, used to create function objects, also known as functors, must be defined as a ***member\*** function, so it always has the implicit `this` argument of member functions. Other than this, it can be overloaded to take any number of additional arguments, including zero.

   Here's an example of the syntax:

   ```cpp
   class foo {
   public:
       // Overloaded call operator
       int operator()(const std::string& y) {
           // ...
       }
   };
   ```

   Usage:

   ```cpp
   foo f;
   int a = f("hello");
   ```

   Throughout the C++ standard library, function objects are always copied. Your own function objects should therefore be cheap to copy. If a function object absolutely needs to use data which is expensive to copy, it is better to store that data elsewhere and have the function object refer to it.

   ## Comparison operators

   The binary infix comparison operators should, according to the rules of thumb, be implemented as non-member functions1. The unary prefix negation `!` should (according to the same rules) be implemented as a member function. (but it is usually not a good idea to overload it.)

   The standard library’s algorithms (e.g. `std::sort()`) and types (e.g. `std::map`) will always only expect `operator<` to be present. However, the *users of your type will expect all the other operators to be present*, too, so if you define `operator<`, be sure to follow the third fundamental rule of operator overloading and also define all the other boolean comparison operators. The canonical way to implement them is this:

   ```cpp
   inline bool operator==(const X& lhs, const X& rhs){ /* do actual comparison */ }
   inline bool operator!=(const X& lhs, const X& rhs){return !operator==(lhs,rhs);}
   inline bool operator< (const X& lhs, const X& rhs){ /* do actual comparison */ }
   inline bool operator> (const X& lhs, const X& rhs){return  operator< (rhs,lhs);}
   inline bool operator<=(const X& lhs, const X& rhs){return !operator> (lhs,rhs);}
   inline bool operator>=(const X& lhs, const X& rhs){return !operator< (lhs,rhs);}
   ```

   The important thing to note here is that only two of these operators actually do anything, the others are just forwarding their arguments to either of these two to do the actual work.

   The syntax for overloading the remaining binary boolean operators (`||`, `&&`) follows the rules of the comparison operators. However, it is *very* unlikely that you would find a reasonable use case for these2.

   1 As with all rules of thumb, sometimes there might be reasons to break this one, too. If so, do not forget that the left-hand operand of the binary comparison operators, which for member functions will be `*this`, needs to be `const`, too. So a comparison operator implemented as a member function would have to have this signature:

   ```cpp
   bool operator<(const X& rhs) const { /* do actual comparison with *this */ }
   ```

   (Note the `const` at the end.)

   2 It should be noted that the built-in version of `||` and `&&` use shortcut semantics. While the user defined ones (because they are syntactic sugar for method calls) do not use shortcut semantics. User will expect these operators to have shortcut semantics, and their code may depend on it, Therefore it is highly advised NEVER to define them.

   ## Arithmetic Operators

   ### Unary arithmetic operators

   The unary increment and decrement operators come in both prefix and postfix flavor. To tell one from the other, the postfix variants take an additional dummy int argument. If you overload increment or decrement, be sure to always implement both prefix and postfix versions. Here is the canonical implementation of increment, decrement follows the same rules:

   ```cpp
   class X {
     X& operator++()
     {
       // do actual increment
       return *this;
     }
     X operator++(int)
     {
       X tmp(*this);
       operator++();
       return tmp;
     }
   };
   ```

   Note that the postfix variant is implemented in terms of prefix. Also note that postfix does an extra copy.2

   Overloading unary minus and plus is not very common and probably best avoided. If needed, they should probably be overloaded as member functions.

   2 Also note that the postfix variant does more work and is therefore less efficient to use than the prefix variant. This is a good reason to generally prefer prefix increment over postfix increment. While compilers can usually optimize away the additional work of postfix increment for built-in types, they might not be able to do the same for user-defined types (which could be something as innocently looking as a list iterator). Once you got used to do `i++`, it becomes very hard to remember to do `++i` instead when `i` is not of a built-in type (plus you'd have to change code when changing a type), so it is better to make a habit of always using prefix increment, unless postfix is explicitly needed.

   ### Binary arithmetic operators

   For the binary arithmetic operators, do not forget to obey the third basic rule operator overloading: If you provide `+`, also provide `+=`, if you provide `-`, do not omit `-=`, etc. Andrew Koenig is said to have been the first to observe that the compound assignment operators can be used as a base for their non-compound counterparts. That is, operator `+` is implemented in terms of `+=`, `-` is implemented in terms of `-=` etc.

   According to our rules of thumb, `+` and its companions should be non-members, while their compound assignment counterparts (`+=` etc.), changing their left argument, should be a member. Here is the exemplary code for `+=` and `+`; the other binary arithmetic operators should be implemented in the same way:

   ```cpp
   class X {
     X& operator+=(const X& rhs)
     {
       // actual addition of rhs to *this
       return *this;
     }
   };
   inline X operator+(X lhs, const X& rhs)
   {
     lhs += rhs;
     return lhs;
   }
   ```

   `operator+=` returns its result per reference, while `operator+` returns a copy of its result. Of course, returning a reference is usually more efficient than returning a copy, but in the case of `operator+`, there is no way around the copying. When you write `a + b`, you expect the result to be a new value, which is why `operator+` has to return a new value.3 Also note that `operator+` takes its left operand ***by copy\*** rather than by const reference. The reason for this is the same as the reason giving for `operator=` taking its argument per copy.

   The bit manipulation operators `~` `&` `|` `^` `<<` `>>` should be implemented in the same way as the arithmetic operators. However, (except for overloading `<<` and `>>` for output and input) there are very few reasonable use cases for overloading these.

   3 Again, the lesson to be taken from this is that `a += b` is, in general, more efficient than `a + b` and should be preferred if possible.

   ## Array Subscripting

   The array subscript operator is a binary operator which must be implemented as a class member. It is used for container-like types that allow access to their data elements by a key. The canonical form of providing these is this:

   ```cpp
   class X {
           value_type& operator[](index_type idx);
     const value_type& operator[](index_type idx) const;
     // ...
   };
   ```

   Unless you do not want users of your class to be able to change data elements returned by `operator[]` (in which case you can omit the non-const variant), you should always provide both variants of the operator.

   If value_type is known to refer to a built-in type, the const variant of the operator should better return a copy instead of a const reference:

   ```cpp
   class X {
     value_type& operator[](index_type idx);
     value_type  operator[](index_type idx) const;
     // ...
   };
   ```

   ## Operators for Pointer-like Types

   For defining your own iterators or smart pointers, you have to overload the unary prefix dereference operator `*` and the binary infix pointer member access operator `->`:

   ```cpp
   class my_ptr {
           value_type& operator*();
     const value_type& operator*() const;
           value_type* operator->();
     const value_type* operator->() const;
   };
   ```

   Note that these, too, will almost always need both a const and a non-const version. For the `->` operator, if `value_type` is of `class` (or `struct` or `union`) type, another `operator->()` is called recursively, until an `operator->()` returns a value of non-class type.

   The unary address-of operator should never be overloaded.

   For `operator->*()` see [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/8777845/140719). It's rarely used and thus rarely ever overloaded. In fact, even iterators do not overload it.

5. 前置操作符，后置操作符

   Most of the unary operators are prefix operators, e.g., `!x`, `-x`. Hence, prefix is the norm for unary operators. However, unary increment and decrement come in two forms: prefix (`++x`, `--x`) and postfix (`x++`, `x--`). We to a mechanism to differentiate the two forms.

   

   Example of unary prefix operators are `!x`, `-x`, `++x` and `--x`. You could do it as a non-member function as well as member function. For example, to overload the prefix increment operator `++`:

   1. To overload as a non-member friend function:

      ```c++
      class Point {
         friend Point & operator++(Point & point);
         ......
      };
      ```

      The compiler translates "++p" to "operator++(p)".

   2. To overload as a member function:

      ```c++
      class Point {
      public:
         Point & operator++();  // this Point
         ......
      };
      ```

      The compiler translates "++p" to "p.operator++()".

   You can use either member function or non-member friend function to overload unary operators, as their only operand shall be an object of that class.

   

   #### Unary Postfix Operator

   The unary increment and decrement operators come in two forms: prefix (`++x`, `--x`) and postfix (`x++`, `x--`). Overloading postfix operators (such as `x++`, x--) present a challenge. It ought to be differentiated from the prefix operator (`++x`, `--x`). A "dummy" argument is therefore introduced to indicate postfix operation as shown below. Take note that postfix `++` shall save the old value, perform the increment, and then return the saved value by value.

   1. To overload as non-memberfriendfunction:

      ```c++
      class Point {
         friend const Point operator++(Point & point, int dummy);
      };
      ```

      The compiler translates "pt++" to "operator++(pt, 0)". Theint argument is strictly a dummy value to differentiate prefix from postfix operation.

   2. To overload as a member function:

      ```c++
      class Point {
      public:
         const Point operator++(int dummy);  // this Point
         ......
      };
      ```

      The compiler translates "pt++" to "pt.operator++(0)".

   前置运算符返回引用(lvalue): 直接在原object上自增，再返回这个object。

   后置运算符返回copy(rvalue): 先存一个临时object，在原object上自增，返回临时object
